Title: Data Imputation CLI and Utilities
Version: 0.1.0
Authors@R: c(person(given = "Eric", family = "Miller", role = c("aut", "cre"), email = "myeagereconomist@gmail.com"))
Description: Provides command-line and programmatic helpers for imputing missing data
    using several strategies (mean, median, mode, k-nearest-neighbors (kNN), and
    distributed random forests (DRF) via H2O).  Includes utilities for reading and
    writing CSVs, rounding numeric columns, progress reporting, and preventing
    data leakage via train/test splits and cross-validation.  A simple CLI
    wrapper (`exec/imputeflow`) exposes these features to the shell.
