\title{`quiet_run(expr)` evaluates `expr` in the parent frame while
temporarily redirecting both stdout and message output to temporary
files.  When evaluation finishes, the sinks are restored and the
result of the expression is returned.  This helper is useful for
running H2O operations inside a CLI where only the final CSV should
be printed to stdout.  Note that messages and printed output are
discarded; if you need to preserve them, use `utils::capture.output`
instead and relay the content via `message()`.}

\arguments{
\item{expr}{An expression to evaluate quietly.}

The value of the expression.
