\title{Impute mean for numeric columns.}
\usage{
impute_mean(df, train_frac = 1, seed = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data frame.}

\item{train_frac}{Fraction of rows to use when computing the mean.}

\item{seed}{RNG seed for reproducible sampling.}
}
\value{
A data frame with missing numeric values replaced by the mean.
}
\description{
For each numeric column in `df`, this function computes the mean on
a random training subset (controlled by `train_frac` and `seed`) and
replaces any missing values in that column with the computed mean.
Only columns containing missing values are modified.  Non-numeric
columns are returned unchanged.
